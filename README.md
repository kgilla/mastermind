#Mastermind

Here is a command line version of the Mastermind boardgame coded in Ruby.
This version uses numbers instead of colors to convey codes and guesses.

##Things I learned while making this:

- Getting slightly more comfortable with the concept of OOP and the implementation of classes.
- Improving my structuring of methods, making code more easily read and debugged
- How to better structure the flow of a program for the end user including better UI

##Things I would like to work on:

- Would like to revisit the project and implement some options for difficulty choices.
- Need to get a better handle of programming basic AI functions to switch roles in program.
